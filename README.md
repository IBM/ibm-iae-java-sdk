## Overview

The IBM Cloud Analytics Engine Services Java SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following IBM Cloud services:

Service Name | Artifact Coordinates 
--- | --- 
[IBM Analytics Engine APIs v2](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/ibm-analytics-engine/ibm-analytics-engine-v2?code=java) | com.ibm.cloud:ibm-analytics-engine-api:1.3.1
[IBM Analytics Engine APIs v3](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/ibm-analytics-engine/ibm-analytics-engine-v3?code=java) | com.ibm.cloud:ibm-analytics-engine-api:1.3.1

The module name for both the versions are same : `ibm-analytics-engine-api`
The two versions are differntiated by the version number in the Java package structure. Example : `com.ibm.cloud.iaesdk.ibm_analytics_engine_api.v2` vs `com.ibm.cloud.iaesdk.ibm_analytics_engine_api.v3`

**NOTE**

IBM Analytics Engine v2 is for the classic plans : Lite, Standard Hourly and Standard monthly.
The classic plans are now deprecated.

IBM Analytics Engine v3 is for the Standard Serverless for Apache Spark plan.


## Prerequisites

[ibm-cloud-onboarding]: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration

* An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
* An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
* Java 8 or above.

## Installation
The current version of this SDK is: 1.3.1

Each service's artifact coordinates are listed in the table above.

The project artifacts are published on the public [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)
artifact repository.  This is the default public repository used by maven when searching for dependencies.
To use this repository within a gradle build, please see
[this link](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html).

To use a particular service in your application, define a dependency that contains the
artifact coordinates (group id, artifact id and version) for the service.
Here are examples for maven and gradle:

##### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ibm.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>ibm-analytics-engine-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Gradle
```gradle
'com.ibm.cloud:ibm-analytics-engine-api:1.3.1'
```
